instantOS is based on [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/), but with a way smaller footprint. The ISO fits on a 2gb USB stick and ram usage on idle is ~140MB.
It uses a custom window manager with a bunch of facilitating custom software to provide an experience similar to a desktop environment but as powerful and
fast as a window manager. In fact, all pieces being made for each other allows things that wouldn't be possible by just editing dotfiles.
