## About

instantOS is based on [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/), but with a way smaller footprint. The ISO fits on a 2gb USB stick and **RAM usage on idle is ~140MB**.
It uses a custom window manager with a bunch of facilitating custom software to provide an experience similar to a desktop environment but as **powerful and
fast as a window manager**. In fact, all pieces being made for each other allows things that wouldn't be possible by just editing dotfiles.

## suckless

instantOS is not a suckless distro. instantWM, intantLOCK and instantMENU started out as suckless forks, but contain less than 40% original suckless code and go into different directions. 
For instance, programs that are under 40kb should not put storage at such a high priority. Stability, features and speed are more important.
