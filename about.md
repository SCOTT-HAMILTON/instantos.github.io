# About

instantOS is based on [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/), but with a way smaller footprint. The ISO fits on a 2gb USB stick and **RAM usage on idle is ~140MB**.
It uses a custom window manager with a bunch of facilitating custom software to provide an experience similar to a desktop environment but as **powerful and
fast as a window manager**. In fact, all pieces being made for each other allows things that wouldn't be possible by just editing dotfiles.

# suckless

instantOS is not a suckless distro. instantWM, intantLOCK and instantMENU started out as suckless forks, but contain over 40% original code and go into different directions. 
For instance, programs that are under 40kb should not put storage at such a high priority. Stability, features and speed are more important. 
You could install all instantOS packages and still need less storage than if you installed a single kde package.
