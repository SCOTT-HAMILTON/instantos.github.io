### Basic explanation
Each window has two modes: Floating and tiling. Tiling is explained here (insert link). 
Floating mode allows you to freely move and resize any window. 

### Activating floating mode. 
To make a window float, press Super + Shift + Space. Alternatively you can just move the window (see "Moving Windows" below) and it'll go into floating mode automatically. 
To make a window return to the tiling layout, either do Super + Shift + Space again or drag it to the top of the display and let go of it just like with regular desktop environments. 

### Moving windows
To move a floating window, hold down the super key and move it around using the left mouse button. 
You can also move it by dragging out its title indicator like on regular desktop environments. This will work no matter where the window is, the cursor will be warped to the window.

### Resizing windows
Super + Right mouse button resizes a window. The cursor will snap to the nearest corner/edge and resize from there. 


The window-drawing feature can also be used to resize and move windows
