## Basics
Windows have two modes: Floating and tiling. The default mode is tiling and is the one taking advantage of layouts.
The OS automatically assigns a position and size to every window in tiling mode. 
It does so according to a simple set of rules called a layout. 

You can see the currently selected layout to the right of the tag indicators. 

## Master and Stack. 
Most layouts have two areas, the master and the stack. 
The master usually contains the main Application you're using like a web browser or text editor while the stack contains additional applications like music players, terminals or file browsers. 
Some layouts also allow to have multiple applications in the master area

Use Super + Shift + Return to put a window into the master or into the stack if it already is in the master area. 

Some layouts also allow resizing the master and stack area. 
The keybinding for this are Super + H and Super + L. 

Reorder windows
Super + Ctrl + J and Super + Ctrl + K makes the current window and the window next to it swap places. 

## Rundown of all layouts

### Grid
Applications get arranged into a grid where earch one gets resized to the same size. It does not distunguish between master or stack.
