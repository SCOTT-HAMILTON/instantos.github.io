# Customize instantWM

instantWM is customized through ~/. Xresources

The syntax for changing a parameter value is the following

``` 
instantwm.parameter: value
```

# bar height

## example

``` 
instantwm.barheight: 2
```

This parameter sets the amount extra rows of pixels that get added to the top and bottom of the title bar. 
Putting 0 here would mean the text would touch the bars boundaries.
