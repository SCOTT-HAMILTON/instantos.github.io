# Settings

The graphical settings manager can be accessed from the start menu, by the name control center in the launcher,
instantsettings in the terminal and by super + left clicking on the status bar. 

Some settings are also available from instantASSIST

### Dotfiles

You might prefer not using the included settings manager and would rather hack together your very own setup. 
The dotfiles setting opens up a config file in vim. Here you can manage which dotfiles are managed and updated by instantOS and which can be manually edited. The instantOS section also allows disabling the management for all dotfiles and disabling the built in theming.
