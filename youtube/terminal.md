# Terminal

## Opening a terminal

A terminal can be opened up by pressing Return on an empty tag or super + Return at any time. 
You can also use the mouse by middle clicking on the status bar in the top right. 

## Copy paste

To highlight text, hold down the shift key and drag out the selection using your mouse. 
You can then press Ctrl + Alt + C to copy the selected text and Ctrl + Alt + V to paste it. 

## tmux
By default, all terminals open in a tmux session. This allows for features like tabs, split windows and detaching from the session. 
Tmux is very well documented so this manual won't go into detail about it.
