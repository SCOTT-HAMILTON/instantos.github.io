## instantOS has three key principles:
1. It just works: Everything is set up straight out of the box, from wifi to brightness controlls and wallpapers. You can install it, 
   learn the keybindings and forget about it.
2. Focused on power users: There's loads of keybindings and powerful features.
3. Speed and low Resource consumption: instantOS sits at 130mb ram at idle. It comes with as little bloat as possible without sacrificing features.
