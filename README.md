## Information

instantOS is based on Manjaro, but with a way smaller footprint. The ISO fits on a 2gb USB stick and ram usage on idle is ~140MB. 
It uses a custom window manager with a bunch of facilitating custom software to provide an experience similar to a desktop environment but as powerful and
fast as a window manager. In fact, all pieces being made for each other allows things that wouldn't be possible by just editing dotfiles. 

## Installation

instantOS has a graphical installer that takes care of everything. 
You install it as you would any distro like Ubuntu
